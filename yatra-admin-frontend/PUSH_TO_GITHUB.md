# Push Admin Frontend to GitHub

## Steps:

1. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Name: `Yatra-Admin` (or your preferred name)
   - Don't initialize with README
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **After creating, run these commands:**

```bash
cd D:\YATRA\yatra-admin-frontend
git remote add origin https://github.com/Kalpit12/Yatra-Admin.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `Kalpit12` with your GitHub username if different.

## Alternative: If repository already exists

If you already created the repo, GitHub will show you the exact commands. Just copy and run them.
